# Getting Started

1. Clone repo onto your local device: `git clone git@github.com:chunloy/arrival-prototype.git`
2. Set up a virtual environment in root folder: `python3 -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install libraries: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
5. Load Jupyter Notebook in browser: `jupyter notebook`
6. Run `deactivate` to close the virtual environment.

_Notes:_

- _map.html is only for visualization purposes and not important to the project_
- _You can ignore script.py as it is only used to generate map.html_
